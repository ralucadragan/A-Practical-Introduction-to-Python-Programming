3. You are given a file called logfile.txt that lists log-on and log-off times for users of a
system. A typical line of the file looks like this:
Van Rossum, 14:22, 14:37

Each line has three entries separated by commas: a username, a log-on time, and a log-off
time. Times are given in 24-hour format. You may assume that all log-ons and log-offs occur
within a single workday.

Write a program that scans through the file and prints out all users who were online for at
least an hour.
